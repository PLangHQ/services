# Environment settings

This modules enables the use of environment settings and .env files

Environment settings are loaded from system first, if .env file exist it is then read and overwrite any setting that exists.

Compared to the built in settings repository in plang, the format of the key can be simpler

Example:
- \__Salt\__=1234
